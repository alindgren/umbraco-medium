[![NuGet release](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/UmbracoMedium.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/UmbracoMedium)

This package allows editors to post content from an Umbraco site to Medium, a popular online publishing platform. It will set the canonical tag to the Umbraco URL. This means that cross posting to Medium will not dilute the SEO value of the content.
